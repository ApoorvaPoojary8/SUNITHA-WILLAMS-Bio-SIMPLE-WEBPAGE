## 🌐 How It Works

The HTML file is stored inside `htmlfolder/` and images are in a separate `images/` folder. To make sure images display correctly in the browser, use relative paths in your HTML like this:

```html
<img src="../images/2.jpg" alt="Sunita Williams" />


The ../ means "go up one level" from htmlfolder/ to the root folder, then look inside images/.
